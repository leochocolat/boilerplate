# boilerplate
## A small html, scss, js workflow for small projects

This workflow is using GulpJS, Sass and browserSync to allows you to compile your SCSS files in CSS files, forget about -webkit- prefixing and earn some time reloading your page with an autoreload system when you save your HTML, SCSS or JS files. 
You can also use BrowserSync to open your html pages on your mobile or other devices simultaneously.
